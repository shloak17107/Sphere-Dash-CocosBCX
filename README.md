# Sphere Dash – with integrated CocosBCX payment system
## How to run our submission
In this version of our game, we have integrated CococsBCX payment system.

Open this project in Cocos Creator and run it in Google Chrome with Cocos Pay extension already installed.

Login in to the extension with this account info: 
* account: `newaccount`
* password: `bhavya100`

Now run the game in the browser. When the game is over, the player will have to send Cocos in proportion to the points he/she has collected in the game. The Cocos are sent to the Cocos Pay account `wasd1`. 

Check the transaction in Cocos Terminal to confirm.
